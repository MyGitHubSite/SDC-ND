Project: Object Detection in an Urban Environment
Starter Code
First, obtain the project files from the related Github repository.

If you are unfamiliar with GitHub, Udacity has a brief GitHub tutorial to get you started. Udacity also provides a more detailed free course on git and GitHub. To learn about README files and Markdown, Udacity provides a free course on READMEs as well.

Submission
Your project will be reviewed based on the criteria in the project rubric.

Note that your project submission is about more than just the code itself - it also includes specifications for code quality, use of good version control, including a Dockerfile or requirements.txt file (which can match to that provided in the starter code) for running your code, as well as a project write-up.

As such, make sure your submission contains at least the following:

Your code implementations within the following files:
Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb
create_splits.py
Any new pipeline .config files
Explore augmentations.ipynb
Any helper files needed to run the above
Evidence of your git history (it is recommended to submit using a Github link)
A Dockerfile or requirements.txt for running your code
A project writeup, which can be either in the project README or its own .md or PDF file, along with requested visualizations
Once you have everything ready and have checked your deliverables against everything in the rubric, you can click the "Submit Project" button on this page.
